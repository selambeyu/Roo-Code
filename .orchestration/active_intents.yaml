# Active intents for intent-governed orchestration
# The model MUST call select_active_intent with one of these ids before making code changes.
# Each intent can have: id, constraints, scope (or owned_scope)

- id: default
  constraints: "General edits within the project. Follow existing patterns and tests."
  scope: ""

- id: docs
  constraints: "Only update documentation, README, and comments. No code behavior changes."
  scope: "docs/"

- id: src
  constraints: "Only change source code under src/. Tests and config unchanged unless specified."
  scope: "src/"
